# J2A6 Data and Variables

###### Add the following functionality to your DataAndVariables program:

1. Calculate and display the result of taking the difference of numberA and numberB (ie. numberA – numberB). Your output should now look like this…

The sum of 12 plus 9 is 21

The difference 12 minus 9 is 3

2. Calculate and display the product of numberA and numberB. Your output should now look like this…

The sum of 12 plus 9 is 21

The difference 12 minus 9 is 3

The product  of 12 times 9 is 108

3. Calculate and display the quotient of numberA and numberB. Your output should follow the same pattern as above…

The sum of 12 plus 9 is 21

The difference 12 minus 9 is 3

The product  of 12 times 9 is 108

The quotient of 12 divided by 9 is...


4. Add the calculation of the remainder of numberA divided by numberB and display the result as above.

5. Take a close look at the results that you got for parts 1, 2 and 3 above.

Does anything look strange?

Can you explain what is happening?

Try to change the numbers assigned to see if you can figure out what is going on. For example, try numberA = 18 and numberB = 9.
